List of changes and fixes TODO:

- Instead of forcing MFD-parts of the texture to client, let the client choose the texture area.

- Client should be able to change its area when it wants to. Support for this.

- Client should be able to change its "mode". Support for this.
  (Request mode    - Client sends a request package to the server when it wants data.
   Continuous mode - Server sends data when it's able. It doesn't wait for client to ask it.)

- The BMP-stuff needs to be revised. It isn't necessary, but it may be helpful for debuggin.
  (To remove or not to..)

- README needs to get updated.
  - A general guide to get started(compiling, configuration, etc.)
  - List of texture areas for different things. MFDs, HUD, RWR, DED...
