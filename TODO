List of changes and fixes TODO:

- Instead of forcing MFD-parts of the texture to client, let the client choose the texture area.

- Instead of opening and closing shared memory everytime the texture is read, open it when server starts and close it when server closes.
  (If opening the memory fails(due to the fact that it's not available) every time Update is called, it should check if the area is open
   and if it isn't, it should try to open it)

- Support for multiple clients.
  (some people may want to display stuff on multiple computers)

- Client should be able to change its area when it wants to. Support for this.

- Client should be able to change its "mode". Support for this.
  (Request mode    - Client sends a request package to the server when it wants data.
   Continuous mode - Server sends data when it's able. It doesn't wait for client to ask it.)

- The BMP-stuff needs to be revised. It isn't necessary, but it may be helpful for debuggin.
  (To remove or not to..)

- README needs to get updated.
  - A general guide to get started(compiling, configuration, etc.)
  - List of texture areas for different things. MFDs, HUD, RWR, DED...
